# mpg_classification

This is the sequel of fuel consumption analysis where we were trying to predict the target value 'mpg' with regression techniques. This time I will reverse the purpose of this project and I set 'origin' as the target label. So, all we got now is a classification problem with 3 labels to predict. The data set remains the same.
